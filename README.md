# 🦚 Peacock

Peacock is a lightweight, FeathersJS-inspired middleware for Express that provides RESTful API endpoints for embedded document database operations and file uploads. It supports both Node.js and browser environments with the same core logic.

⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This project is still under active development. APIs may change, and breaking updates are possible until a stable release is published.

It is **strongly recommended to start with the browser-based version**, and only migrate to a server when it's time to actually share data between users. This helps reduce setup complexity and makes development faster and more self-contained.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗃️ **Embedded Document Database API**  
  REST-style endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to interact with NeDB collections scoped by namespace. Collections are created on-demand—no need for pre-registration.

- 📁 **File Upload API**  
  Upload files via `multipart/form-data`, automatically store them under a unique URL, and support retrieval. **Note:** File uploads are stored separately and have no connection to NeDB.

- 🔄 **Pluggable Hooks**  
  Add custom middleware logic (`before`, `after`, and `around`) per collection. The hook system is designed to mimic [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com)'s service lifecycle hooks for familiarity and flexibility.

- 🌐 **Dual Environment Support**  
  Works in both Node.js (with Express) and browser (with localForage).

- 🧩 **Extensible Roadmap**  
  A MongoDB adapter and built-in mail sending functionality are planned for future releases.

## 🌍 Usage in the browser

You can use Peacock directly in the browser by importing it and adding it as a middleware to [xfetch](https://github.com/yourusername/xfetch):

```js
import xfetch from 'https://esm.sh/@camilaprav/xfetch';
import peacock from 'https://esm.sh/@camilaprav/peacock';

// Register Peacock as a middleware
xfetch.middlewares.push(peacock);
```

To target the local (in-browser) Peacock middleware, requests must be made to the `peacock://` protocol:

```js
await xfetch('peacock://browser/db/myspace/users');
await xfetch('peacock://browser/upload/myspace', { body: formData });
```

To switch to a real server implementation later, simply change your `xfetch` request URLs to standard HTTPS that points to a Peacock server:

```js
await xfetch('https://api.example.com/db/myspace/users');
```

This allows you to use the same request logic in both environments with minimal changes.

## 🧩 Hooks API

You can register lifecycle hooks for specific collections:

```js
peacock.hooks('myspace/users', {
  before: [
    async (ctx) => {
      if (ctx.method === 'create') {
        ctx.data.createdAt = new Date();
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

Available hook types: `around`, `before`, `after`.

The hook system mimics FeathersJS's lifecycle model, allowing you to extend and customize behavior with familiar patterns.

Each hook receives a `ctx` object:
```js
{
  method,     // One of: 'get', 'find', 'create', 'update', 'remove'
  id,         // Document ID (if applicable)
  params,     // URL query parameters
  data,       // Request body (for POST/PUT)
  result,     // The result to send back
  req,        // Raw Express request
  res         // Raw Express response
}
```

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camilaprav/peacock
cd peacock
npm install
```

To build the server and browser versions:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:
- `peacock.server.js` – for use in Node.js environments.
- `peacock.browser.js` – for use in browser apps.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Server Usage

### Start the server

```bash
node server.js
```

### Database API

`/db/:namespace/:collection[/:id]`

Collections are created automatically upon first access—no setup required.

#### Examples

- `GET /db/myspace/users` – find documents
- `GET /db/myspace/users/:id` – get one document
- `POST /db/myspace/users` – insert document
- `PUT /db/myspace/users` – update document (by `_id`)
- `DELETE /db/myspace/users?name=John` – remove matching documents

### File Upload

`POST /upload/:namespace`  
Uploads a file under the given namespace.

#### Request

- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Form field: `file`

#### Response
```json
{
  "namespace": "myspace",
  "id": "generated-id",
  "url": "/uploads/myspace/generated-id/filename.ext"
}
```

## 🧪 Development Notes

- **Browser version** uses ES modules and `localForage` for simulated file storage.
- Designed to be environment-agnostic while maintaining modularity and clarity.

## 🧠 Inspiration

Peacock is inspired by [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com), but takes a more minimal and file-centric approach. It aims to be portable, environment-aware, and easy to plug into any web stack.
